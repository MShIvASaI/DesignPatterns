Here is a C++ example of the Builder Design Pattern for constructing different types of meals, followed by common and advanced interview questions about this pattern.

### Builder Design Pattern Example: Meals in C++

This implementation builds different types of meals (Veg Meal and Non-Veg Meal) step by step:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

// Product: Meal
class Meal {
    string mainItem;
    string sideItem;
    string drink;
public:
    void setMainItem(const string& main) { mainItem = main; }
    void setSideItem(const string& side) { sideItem = side; }
    void setDrink(const string& d) { drink = d; }
    void showMeal() const {
        cout << "Main Item: " << mainItem 
             << ", Side Item: " << sideItem 
             << ", Drink: " << drink << endl;
    }
};

// Abstract Builder
class MealBuilder {
protected:
    Meal* meal;
public:
    MealBuilder() { meal = new Meal(); }
    virtual ~MealBuilder() { delete meal; }
    virtual void buildMainItem() = 0;
    virtual void buildSideItem() = 0;
    virtual void buildDrink() = 0;
    Meal* getMeal() { return meal; }
};

// Concrete Builder for Veg Meal
class VegMealBuilder : public MealBuilder {
public:
    void buildMainItem() override { meal->setMainItem("Veg Burger"); }
    void buildSideItem() override { meal->setSideItem("Salad"); }
    void buildDrink() override { meal->setDrink("Orange Juice"); }
};

// Concrete Builder for Non-Veg Meal
class NonVegMealBuilder : public MealBuilder {
public:
    void buildMainItem() override { meal->setMainItem("Chicken Burger"); }
    void buildSideItem() override { meal->setSideItem("Fries"); }
    void buildDrink() override { meal->setDrink("Coke"); }
};

// Director
class MealDirector {
    MealBuilder* builder;
public:
    void setBuilder(MealBuilder* b) { builder = b; }
    void constructMeal() {
        builder->buildMainItem();
        builder->buildSideItem();
        builder->buildDrink();
    }
    Meal* getMeal() { return builder->getMeal(); }
};

int main() {
    MealDirector director;

    VegMealBuilder vegBuilder;
    director.setBuilder(&vegBuilder);
    director.constructMeal();
    Meal* vegMeal = director.getMeal();
    vegMeal->showMeal();

    NonVegMealBuilder nonVegBuilder;
    director.setBuilder(&nonVegBuilder);
    director.constructMeal();
    Meal* nonVegMeal = director.getMeal();
    nonVegMeal->showMeal();

    return 0;
}
```

This separates the meal construction process, allowing creation of different meal variants using the same builder steps.[^1][^2][^3]

### Types of Meals Illustrated

- **Veg Meal**: Veg burger, salad, orange juice.
- **Non-Veg Meal**: Chicken burger, fries, coke.


### Interview Questions and Variations

Typical questions asked about the Builder pattern in interviews include:

- What is the Builder design pattern and what problem does it solve?[^3][^1]
- Explain the main roles (Product, Builder, ConcreteBuilder, Director) in your code.
- Can Builder pattern handle products with many optional fields? How?
- How is Builder different from Factory Method and Abstract Factory patterns?[^4]
- Can method chaining (fluent interface) be used in C++ with the Builder pattern?[^5]
- Do you always need a Director class in Builder? When might it be omitted?[^1][^3]
- What are the pros and cons of the Builder pattern with respect to readability, immutability, and maintainability?[^6]
- Can you extend the code to add new types of meals or new components (like desserts)? What changes are needed?
- How would you test a class that uses Builder?
- Describe a scenario where Builder greatly improves code quality over using overloaded constructors or setters.

These questions focus on understanding, differences from other creational patterns, extensibility, and practical impact in real designs.Here’s an example of the Builder Design Pattern in C++ for various types of meals, followed by common interview question variations.[^7][^3][^1]

These address construction flexibility, pattern structure, extensibility, and real-world usage.[^7][^3][^6][^1]
